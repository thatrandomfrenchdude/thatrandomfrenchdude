### Hi, I'm Nick 👋🏼

<p>
I build brains for machines and bridges between people. My work blends deep technical engineering with human connection, because great tech doesn’t live in a vacuum.
</p>
<p>
Infinitely curious, I am passionate about elegant solutions and efficient processes. I’ve worn many hats on my quest for knowledge: AI/ML engineer, full-stack developer, data scientist, teacher, and researcher.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work, I'm a creative spirit. You’ll find me writing music, flowing through yoga, tending plants, playing chess, or studying something weird and wonderful. Through all walks of life, I love helping people solve problems, spark ideas, and feel a little more joy in the process.
</p>
<p>
I lead a weekly all-levels yoga class on Fridays at 6pm in Vista, California. If you’re in the area, come join me for some movement and mindfulness.
