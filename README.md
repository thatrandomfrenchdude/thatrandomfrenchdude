### Hi there, I'm Nick 👋🏼

I am a self-motivated, driven software engineer with a strong passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization. I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from many different perspectives, even if it means trying and failing many times with new ideas. The solution is always out there, waiting for us to find it.

I am comfortable working with the following, and I enjoy learning and integrating new languages and tools to support optimal development:
- Python (async, multiprocessing, pytorch, numpy, pandas, django, flask, fastAPI, awswrangler)
- Javascript/Typescript (react, node)
- AWS (lamda, ec2, athena, s3, glue)
- SQL (postgres, sqlite, ms sql)
- C/C++ (including embedded)
- HTML/CSS
- C#

In my spare time I enjoy learning, making music, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life with others.
