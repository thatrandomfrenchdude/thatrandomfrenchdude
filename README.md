### Hi there, I'm Nick üëãüèº

I am a self-motivated, driven software engineer with a strong passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization.

I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from many different perspectives under the lenses of diverse disciplines. To that end, I am always seeking new knowledge and experiences that I can incorporate into my creations.

I am comfortable working with the following:
- Python (async, multiprocessing, pytorch, numpy, pandas, django, flask, fastAPI, awswrangler)
- Javascript/Typescript (react, node)
- AWS (lamda, ec2, athena, s3, glue)
- SQL (postgres, sqlite, ms sql)
- C/C++ (including embedded)
- HTML/CSS
- C#

I enjoy learning and integrating new languages, tools, and ways of thinking to support optimal solution development. If there is a better way to solve a problem that I have not been exposed to, I will expose myself to it and make sure I can integrate it into my solution.

In my spare time I making music, reading, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life and knowledge with everyone I can!
