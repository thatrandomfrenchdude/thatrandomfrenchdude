### Hi, I'm Nick 👋🏼

<p>
I build brains for machines and bridges between people. My work blends deep technical engineering with human connection, because great tech doesn’t live in a vacuum.
</p>
<p>
Infinitely curious, I am passionate about elegant solutions and efficient processes. I’ve worn many hats in my professional life: AI/ML engineer, full-stack developer, data scientist, teacher, and researcher.

<p>
Outside of work, I'm a creative spirit. You’ll find me writing music, flowing through yoga, tending plants, playing chess, or studying something weird and wonderful. Through all walks of life, I love helping people solve problems, spark ideas, and feel a little more joy in the process.

I lead a weekly all-levels yoga class on Fridays at 6pm in Vista, California. If you’re in the area, come join me for some movement and mindfulness.

<!-- I am an AI/ML, full stack software, and data engineer with a passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization. I am the AI Developer Advocate at Qualcomm where I am building the Qualcomm AI developer community and supporting ecosystem.

I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from many perspectives. I am comfortable working across the stack in Python, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, C/C++ (including embedded), and C#. I enjoy learning and integrating new languages, tools, and ways of thinking to support optimal solution development. When I encounter solutions better than my best, I make sure to understand and integrate them into my work.

In my time outside of tech, I enjoy making music, practicing yoga, reading, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life and accumulated knowledge with everyone I can! -->
