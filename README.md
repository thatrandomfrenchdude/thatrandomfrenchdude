### Hi there, I'm Nick 👋🏼

I am an AI/ML, full stack software, and and data engineer with a passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization. I am currently working at Qualcomm as their AI Developer Advocate where I am responsible for building and developing the Qualcomm AI developer ecosystem and community.

I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from many perspectives. I am comfortable working across the stack in Python, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, C/C++ (including embedded), and C#. I enjoy learning and integrating new languages, tools, and ways of thinking to support optimal solution development. When I encounter solutions better than my best, I make sure to understand and integrate them into my work.

In my time outside of tech, I enjoy making music, practicing yoga, reading, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life and accumulated knowledge with everyone I can!
