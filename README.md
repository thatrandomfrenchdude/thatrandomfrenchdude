### Hi there, I'm Nick üëãüèº

I am a self-motivated, driven software and data engineer with a strong passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization.

I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from the perspective of many different disciplines. To that end, I am always seeking new knowledge and experiences that I can incorporate into my creations.

I am comfortable working in Python, Javascript/Typescript, HTML, CSS, C/C++ (including embedded), and C#.

I enjoy learning and integrating new languages, tools, and ways of thinking to support optimal solution development. If there is a better way to solve a problem to which I have not been exposed, I will expose myself to it and make sure I can integrate it into my solutions moving forward.

In my spare time I enjoy making music, reading, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life and accumulated knowledge with everyone I can!
