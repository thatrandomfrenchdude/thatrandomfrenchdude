### Hi there 👋🏼

#### 📚 About Me

I am a self-motivated, driven software engineer with a strong passion for efficiency, optimization, and organization. I firmly believe that the best solution to any problem can be found by examining it from many different perspectives, even if it means trying and failing many times with new ideas. The solution is always out there, waiting for us to find it.

When I solve problems, my solution is always built around the problem instead of modifying the problem to fit an easy or existing solution. The software I develop is efficient and modular, with the expectation that it can be both time and space optimized to the use-case and reused in similar scenarios. I am comfortable working in Python, JS/HTML/CSS, SQL, C/C++ (including embedded), and C#, and I can learn and integrate new languages and knowledge quickly to support solutions as needed. I am also comfortable working with hardware and AWS infrastructure as well.

In my spare time I enjoy learning, making music, playing chess, gardening, and baking. I am always looking for ways to improve the world around me by sharing my joy for life with others.
